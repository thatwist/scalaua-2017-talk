# Demistifying Type Class Derivation with Shapeless

???

Lets get started
(slightly smile smile smile)
Thanks everybody for coming here

Hi everybody, thanks for attending scalaua conference, and thanks scalaua cometee and Ruslan for giving me a chance to be here

# Some conceptual image-slide <scary>

???

have you been scared when you seen shapeless for the first time? like I was? Well then I will try to demystify some of the things
this is for you

Today I’m going to talk about some things around generic programming in scala (compiler) capabilities of handling
I’m not the expert neither in shapeless (as you can see the title of the talk have it) nor in how scala compiler works
I’m just a guy who was once very [amazed|impressed|astounded|stunned] by beauty and elegance of some of the capabilities provided by this library
but and I was struggling with understanding and applying those patterns on practice
And the reason of it was a lack of some background and theory.
Even when I get further with exploring some of the more advanced features and capabilities of that library
I felt like I'm not really getting the whole point - I didn't know how to approach that library

So this talk is for those of you who felt scared (like I was) or felt that you are miss something when you saw shapeless code the first time
because knowledge is a power and <не знаня> makes you feel scared and aggreessive)
{this is the information I wanted somebofy to gave me 1-2 years ago when I met shapeless for the first time}

The idea of derivation is used in many libraries and itself it is considered somewhat "library-thing"?? - like shapeless is made for those who write libraries - it is too complex for regular production usage

<!-- this is  -->
// The level of a talk would be around middle scala-dev who just started to investigate shapeless library or at least have strong understanding what implicits in scala do and is aware of basic capabilities of a type system in scala.

# Agenda

* Introduction
* Being Generic
* Type Classes ftw
* Live coding

???

1. Introduction
2. ADTs -> HList
3. Generic programming
4. Type Class pattern
5. Live coding

I will try to explain some of the basics and kind-of extend understanding of the ADT types and have a look at them from some different maybe higher perspective
and then we will try to do some livecoding and will take a look at some of the aries of application of those patterns - basically where we can use it what is value?

I hope I will bring you some useful and some understanding of the core concepts and possibilities type-driven development can bring you in scala.

quick agenda
  - ADTs from the generalized perspective
  - Generic programming concept
  - HList concept
  - Type-class pattern
  - Generic derivation
  --
  - Generic programming concept
  - Quick overview of what HList is and how it is implemented in Shapeless library
  - Type-class pattern overiview in scala
  - ADTs and Generic representation for products and coproducts in Shapeless
  - Livecoding - 
  - AUX pattern
  - Livecoding
  - shapeless.Lazy
  - Aux type pattern in shapeless

# Generic programming

[*center]
```scala
def fmap[A](f: A => B): F[B] = ???
```

???

speaking very simply - this is it - whenever you use generics you do Generic programming
and that means you do a kind of programming when you write algorithms in terms of not-yet defined types

In such way we are generalizing over common properties of functions/objects

this is what generic programming is all about

of course - there certain technics more sophisticated then just writing

.......
concretising too early - lean software development methodologies - make a decisions as late as possible




one of those techincs - is type definition
very simple at first - it enables a lot more sophisticated in connection with implicits

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

# What about ADTs?

Abstracting over arity
--

/OK THIS PROBABLY IRRELEVANT / TOO EASY - show ADTs -> Tuples -> Eithers -> ??? (HList)
```scala
  case class Employee(name: String, age: Integer)
--
//              ||
//              \/
      Tuple2[String, Integer] // abstracting over ADT name
--
//              ||
//              \/
          Tuple2[A, B]
--
//              ||
//              \/
            Tuple[N]??? 
```

## _How to abstract over arity of a product?_

kind-of move this TupleN to Tuple[N]


???

so the arity is basically number of fields
Well we will see later

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
---
name: hlist

# HList

```scala
sealed trait HList
case class HCons[H, T <: HList] extends HList
case object HNil extends HList
```

???

starts from the very simple idea of recursive types
something beautiful about FP - the simpler idea is the better it composes

This is a way to abstract over arity

So this basically a type recursion
and this is something you can see in a 
btw in scala 2.12 the annotation @showAsInfix was added which enables infix type printing in console
(move below - after HList or when complex structure goes) going further for a minute - this is something which can help debugging

naming Product <-> HList
The idea behind HList is very very simple - .. recursive types
The capabilities of type system in Java is enough to implement this - it will take you 20-30 lines
or any other language - the plus of scala is that it allows infix type syntax which make possible following notation (A1 :: A2 :: … :: HNil)

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

name: type-class

# Type Class

```scala
trait Encoder[A] {
  def encode(a: A): String
}
```

???

The idea behind type-class pattern is very similar (in some sense) to implicit class pattern
Came from haskell

Ordered(Ordering)

For those of you who is not familiar with type-class pattern - you can think about implicit class
the very functional type of polymorphism - when we extend functionality of some class without touching it
on the contrary of inheritance in OOP polymorphism
implicit class on steroids - what if you need to provide different implementations depending on some polymorphic type?
lets look at the following:
trait Encoder[A] {
  def encode(a: A): String
}
as you can see there is no implicits or anything scary here - it just very abstract definition of some functionality
you capture very basic functionality into interface

then lets define some instances - lets say we need to encode Int

--

```scala
object Encoder {

  def apply[A](implicit encoder: Encoder[A]): Encoder[A] = encoder

  implicit class WithEncode[A](a: A) {
    def encode(implicit encoder: Encoder[A]) = encoder.encode(a)
  }
}
```

thats it - this is the basic idea - once you start using type-classes and build your functionality around it
at some point you will have to deal with ADTs

You just need to start looking at the definition from the trait - typeclass definition
and there can be a bunch of other stuff with implicits resolution helpers - apply,implicit class - but the main thing to look at is trat definition

and then comes implicit instances -

```scala
@typeclass trait Encoder[A] {
  @op("§") def encode(a: A): String
}
```

???

First-class construciton in Haskell 98 - Eq, Ord, Enum, Bound, Show, Read
THere is a library named simulacrum which enables it fo;r scala
and Cats uses it
Well, it is just simple macro but maybe someday it could start to be a part of scala language reserved word
the same way we have `case class` generating a whole bunch of stuff with hascode equals getterss setters and stuff

Really nice way for expressing
although it's obvious that this is just a workaround and kind-of temporary solution until real first-class support will be added. I believe

Lets look at another example



<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
---
name: aux

# Aux Pattern

Aux https://youtu.be/GKIfu1WtSz4?t=1125

For instnace we want this type to be a part of

so we can reuse it later in a dependent-type way

<--provide better use-case >

```scala
trait Foo[B] {
  type B
  def bar(a: A): Boolean
}
  def foo[T](t: T)(implicit f: Foo[T], m: Monoid[f.B]): f.B = m.zero
```

???

Aux pattern is something which comes naturally from constrains
but if you are not familiar with it - and you don't follow the way that the author of the code has been following while - you can't understand the reason

Whenever you need to summon instance with dependent type like `Foo[???] { type B = ??? }`
you need to use type alias -> Aux pattern

name: generic?


```scala
trait Generic[A] {

  def to(value: A): Repr
  def from(value: Repr): A

--

what if we would encode Repr as type parameter rather than type member?

--

```scala
trait Generic[A, Repr] {
  def to(value: A): Repr
  def from(value: Repr): A
}
```

then we can't reuse it in some other context

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
---

# Dependent types concept

- neat syntax enabled by implicit's sugar

this makes scala dependent-typed? language


<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
---
name: dep-fns

# Dependent typed functions

???
We've already seen a Last, Init type classes (or something else)
Lets think about application of them and remind classic scala function definitions


<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
---
template: dep-fns

```scala
  trait Function0[R] {

    def apply(): R
  }

  trait Function1[T, R] {

    def apply(t: T): R
  }
```

---
template: dep-fns
```scala
  trait DependentFunction0 {
*   type Out
    def apply(): Out
  }

  trait DependentFunction1[T] {
*   type Out
    def apply(t: T): Out
  }
```

???

The idea is to have a type inside a trait with apply - we can output type in some other

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
---

.. <livecode> chaining dependent type functions (with Aux)

# Type-class composition ???

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
---

# Going a little bit further

- values dependent on types
- types dependent on types (type constructors) higher-kinded types
- types dependent on values (dependent types)

```

In order to provide some even more context - lets look at the , and try to kind of categorize these

/?do not talk about something youre not fully familiar with//// btw - such categorization comes from mathematic logic and type theory  - there is something called Lambda cube ////


<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

# Capture field names?

```scala
//                   label       label
//                    ||          ||
//                    \/          \/
case class Employee(name: String, age: Integer)
//            /\
//            ||  
//           label  
```
__

LabbeledGeneric

???

Well the HList abstraction is not very suitable to represent real-world domain
as it lacks very important piece of infromation about data - meta data - field names.
Hlist itself can be considered as ResultSet in jdbc therminology - but we need a schema for that



Wel, what if need smth more generic
What if we need to serialize to json - we need field names
In fact its meta information

Think about schema in relational databases - we have resultSet

What HList lacks in fact is these labels 

Here comes HMap which intuitively understandable concept
once you know about HList -> Hlist with labbeled data (field names)

projections


other real-life use cases
not only for designing new libraries
any kind of typesafe ADT serialization/deserialization
any 

until we have some time - lets go through some of the other use cases or other operations you can do
you can do your own implementation of

WELL,
many people consider shapeless as a tool a library  to use to construct other libraries
I’m not particularly agree
The essence of shapeless, from my point of view, is to use it in a very minimalistic way

as there are a lot of 
And here is one example I was very confused about long time ago
<…>
and I felt like I need to use shapeless


I don't think that HList and Coproducts should be used to model entire domain - well it can
but from my perspective you should always choose the minimal abstraction - as premature optimizations are a root of all evel as we all know


i want to pay your attent to the very minimalistic usage of shapeless api - and its usually like that

this is what makes shapeless neat and elegant
and this small thing enables generality
and makes scala so versatily

# Conclusion

(Type austronaout ) - this is just a small part that I showed you
resources: ,,,

When going for the purity you may miss some very important thing - “practicality”
When you are in production you still should keep something in your mind -  always be driven by the domain needs and business goals
unless you are making a research or building next generation of astronauts' <...>
we are all tech guys and sometimes are too idealistic and “out-of-this-world” with our experiments
Sometimes experiments may lead to 
I think its essential to keep in mind real use-cases
which makes really very bad advert for such libraries and methodologies like shapeless

Such a powerful tools doesn’t mean you have to use them everywhere in every possible situation
in fact - Practical usage shoudl always be very concise - that makes such libraries and approaches so beautyful

 end: Well, scala exposes really great possibility of combining type-dependent with less-type safe mutable
